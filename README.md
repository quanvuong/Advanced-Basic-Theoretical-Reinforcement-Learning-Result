# Advanced Basic Theoretical Reinforcement Learning Result

By advanced, I mean that one would not find these results in a graduate level RL class, or even popular RL textbooks. The results are mostly found in RL research papers.

By basic, I mean that these results seem general enough that they can be used as building block for more complicated result.

Theory usually progresses one lemma at a time, so I thought it is a good idea to collate these results into one document for easy reference.

Jul 21 2019: I have since realized the futility of this :). Just paper notes for now.
